### Baseline measurement methods (§N12 — every count states its method)

| Count | Method |
|---|---|
| 397 passed / 0 failed | Character count of the `-q` progress rows in the §0 step-2 log: `head -6 log \| grep -o '^\.\+' \| awk '{s+=length($0)}'` = 397 dots; a separate scan for `s/S/x/X/w/u/I` status characters in the same rows returned 0. **The suite's own output contains no `passed` summary line** — see D-L1-04. |
| 80.24% | `Total coverage: 80.24%` emitted by `uv run pytest -q --cov --cov-report=term-missing`; TOTAL row = 7643 stmts / 1267 miss / 2166 brpart 439 / 80%. |
| 0 issues (claims) | `uv run python scripts/check_public_claims.py` stdout line 1, exit 0. |
| 730 tracked files | `git ls-files \| wc -l` (not a filesystem walk). |
| 2 untracked lines | `git status --short` exit 0. Both accounted for: `data-science-agent/` per §3.2, and `REPO_DIAGNOSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT.md`, which §24 R1 names as expected ("the tree is otherwise clean apart from this document and your ledger"). §4's "at most two untracked lines" enumerates `data-science-agent/` + `AUDIT_LEDGER.md` and omits the prompt document itself — a self-inconsistency in the instructions, not a dirty tree. |
| pytest mark.skip/xfail = 0 | `grep -rnE "pytest\.mark\.(skip|xfail)\|xfail" packages apps/api src tests scripts docs --include='*.py' \| grep -v _vendor` → 0 hits. A broader pattern including `skip\(` returns 2 hits, both `pytest.importorskip` at `tests/unit/test_data_engine.py:5-6` — a different mechanism, see D-L1-05. |
| TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX = 0 | `grep -rnE "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" packages apps/api src tests scripts docs --include='*.py' \| grep -v _vendor` → 0 hits. Scoped to `.py` in those directories; not a whole-repo or markdown scan. |
| mypy 108 files | The `Success:` line's own file count from `uv run mypy packages apps/api src --ignore-missing-imports`. |

### Baseline verdict — GREEN, with one explained exception

§0 steps 1 and 2 (the gates §4 makes stop-conditions) exit 0. Coverage 80.24%
is inside the predicted 79–81% band. Step 3's vendor and npm-lock gates exit 0.
Step 4 matches §4's expectation once the prompt document is accounted for.
Step 5 behaves exactly as §4 predicts: exit 0 **and** no CI wiring.

Two anomalies, both explained, neither a baseline failure:

1. `python scripts/render_leaderboard.py --check` as written exits **127** —
   `command not found: python`. Only `python3` (`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`) and
   `uv` are on PATH. The gate itself **passes** when run through the interpreter
   that exists. §33's rule for this case is explicit: record it as a finding and
   carry on. Filed as **D-L1-01**.
2. The documented §0/§23 pytest command emits **no test-count line**. §28 stop
   criterion 1 ("not green and you cannot explain why") is not triggered because
   the cause is understood; filed as **D-L1-04**.

## Lane L1 — Verification integrity

**Question (§10):** *Which of this repository's checks cannot fail?*

**Integrity disclosure first.** The session instruction was to read the prompt
document *in full*, and full reading includes §32. So §N9's literal ordering
(enumerate before reading the seed) is not something my own enumeration can
claim. Mitigation actually applied: (a) every item below is derived from
repository evidence with a command behind it, not from the seed; (b) a second,
seed-unaware enumeration was produced by a subagent explicitly barred from
opening `REPO_DIAGNOSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT.md` and `AUDIT_LEDGER.md`, and
its claims were re-verified against source before being recorded; (c) the
lead-register diff appears only after this block. Items that came from the
subagent rather than from me are marked **[blind-agent]**.

**Probes run.** §10's method table applied per gate: run + record exit code;
`grep -rn <gate> .github/`; violate the gate in a `/tmp` scratch copy and
re-run; read the exit-code path; read the skip/filter logic; read the config the
gate depends on. No file under `src/data_science_agent/_vendor/` was read-edited
or written (§R3); `git status --short` after all probes still shows only the two
expected untracked lines.

| Gate | Defined / invoked at | Wired? | Can it exit non-zero on what it claims to detect? | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `uv sync --dev` / `uv lock --check` | `ci.yml:73-74` | yes | yes (uv-owned) | trustworthy |
| `pytest --cov` + `fail_under=79` | `ci.yml:87`, `pyproject.toml:187` | yes | yes — but see D-L1-10 (no count in output) | trustworthy-with-caveat |
| `ruff check` | `ci.yml:84` | yes | yes for most rules; **no for S110** | **neutered-by-config** (D-L1-02) |
| `ruff format --check` | `ci.yml:85` | yes | yes (probe: `179 files already formatted`, exit 0) | trustworthy |
| `mypy --strict` | `ci.yml:86` | yes | yes, but `apps/jupyter` is not in its path list | **partial coverage** (D-L1-06) |
| `sync_vendor.py --check` | `ci.yml:75` | yes | yes for content drift; **no** for orphaned copies | **silent-pass subset** (D-L1-04) |
| `check_npm_workspace_lock.py` | `ci.yml:76` | yes | yes (exit 0; `return 1` path at script `:52-88`) | trustworthy |
| `render_leaderboard.py --check` | `leaderboard.yml:32` only, **path-filtered** | partial | yes, but only when `benchmarks/leaderboard/**` or the script itself change | **not-wired-for-normal-PRs** |
| `check_public_claims.py` | **nowhere** (`grep -rn check_public_claims .github/` → exit 1) | **no** | only for 3 of 9 finding kinds | **not-wired + silent-pass** (D-L1-03) |
| `mkdocs build --strict` | `ci.yml:163`, piped to `tail` | yes | **no** — twice over (config + pipe) | **neutered-by-config + masked exit** (D-L1-01, D-L1-05) |
| `generate_sbom.py && test -f release/sbom.json` | `ci.yml:88` | yes | no — the step creates the file it then asserts | **vacuous assertion** (D-L1-08) |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `ci.yml:83` | yes | yes (not executed this session) | untested |
| Web build / regression | `ci.yml:39,161` piped to `tail` | yes | exit code masked | **masked** (D-L1-01) |
| `docker compose config` | `ci.yml:162`, piped to `head` | yes | exit code masked | **masked** (D-L1-01) |
| Benchmark `dsa --limit 5` | `ci.yml:89`, piped to `tail` | yes | exit code masked | **masked** (D-L1-01) |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | local only; **absent from CI** (`grep -rn pre-commit .github/` → exit 1) | no | no — both hooks mutate (`ruff --fix`, `ruff-format` without `--check`) | **not-a-gate** (D-L1-09) |
| `conftest.py` `_vendor` demotion | `conftest.py:26-36`, inside `except Exception: pass` | n/a | n/a — a harness shim, not a gate; nothing verifies it | **verification gap** (D-L1-07) |
| Tests asserting on gate output | `tests/test_automation_scripts.py` | n/a | asserts only on pure helpers; **no test asserts any checker's exit code or stdout** | gap, folded into D-L1-03 |

**Exit-code-path reads.** `check_public_claims.py:248-258` filters to kinds
starting `version_consistency|old_package_pip|old_repo`; everything else prints
and returns 0. `:222-233` skips prefixes `docs/ research/ benchmarks/ plugins/
apps/jupyter/ src/data_science_agent/`. `EXPECTED` keys referenced: only
`version` (`:172,173,184,185,187`). `sync_vendor.py:48-50` `WARN: missing source`
→ `continue`; `main()` calls `sync()` unconditionally (`:85`) which does
`shutil.rmtree` + `copytree` (`:74-75`).

**Novel relative to the seed.** D-L1-01 (pipeline exit-code masking across five
steps), D-L1-02 (S110 disabled in exactly the trees that hold the swallowed
exceptions), D-L1-04 (orphaned-vendor blind spot + `--check` mutates, which
contradicts §24 R3's stated safety model), D-L1-06 (`apps/jupyter` never
type-checked), D-L1-08 (self-satisfying SBOM assertion), D-L1-10 (`-qq` count
blindness), D-L1-11 (`importorskip` on mandatory dependencies). Exhaustiveness
is **not** claimed for L1: `actionlint`, `npm audit`, `regression.mjs`, the
wheel/Docker steps, and `publish.yml`'s reduced gate set were catalogued but not
probed. **[blind-agent]** independently reached the mkdocs, claims-checker,
pre-commit and conftest conclusions; those were re-verified here.

### Findings

Severity was assigned after tier, per §7, and no severity exceeds its tier's
ceiling. No finding here is rated S0: §8's S0 requires an **outward** status or
public claim to be wrong, and `README.md:18-21` carries no CI status badge
(checked by grep), so a falsely-green pipeline is an internal signal. Rating these
S0 would be §25 A4.

### D-L1-01
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | Five `run:` steps in `ci.yml` pipe a gate into `tail`/`head` without `pipefail`, so the step reports success even when the gate fails. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S1 |
| location | `.github/workflows/ci.yml:39, :89, :161, :162, :163` |
| mechanism | GitHub Actions' default Linux shell is `bash --noprofile --norc -e` — `-e` without `-o pipefail`. A pipeline's status is the last command's, so `tail`'s 0 replaces the gate's. The five steps that use a pipe are exactly the ones **not** given the explicit `shell: bash` + `set -euo pipefail` header the file's multi-line blocks use (`:61-63, :91-93, :99-101, :122-124, :166-168`). `mkdocs build --strict` — the docs gate §23 lists and `CONTRIBUTING.md:28` mandates — therefore cannot fail CI at all, independently of D-L1-05. |
| evidence_command | `bash --noprofile --norc -e -c 'false \| tail -n 1'; echo $?` then the real gate piped as written |
| output_excerpt | `step_exit=0` (Actions-default shell) vs `step_exit=1` (with `-o pipefail`); real gate: `mkdocs_direct_exit=2` / `mkdocs_piped_exit=0` |
| reproducible | deterministic (≥2 runs) |
| fix_sketch | Add `shell: bash` + `set -euo pipefail` to those five steps, or drop the pipes. Breaks: would newly fail CI on any latent web-build/benchmark/docs error that has been masking. |
| blast_radius | `ci.yml` only; no source, no public contract. Consequence: three gates (docs-strict, web build ×2, benchmark, compose) currently produce false confidence. |
| verify_before | `uv run python -m mkdocs build --strict -f /tmp/audit0/missing.yml 2>&1 \| tail -n 50; echo $?` → `pipeline_exit=0` while the same command unwrapped gives exit 2 |
| verify_after | — not applied: requires a workflow edit (§R7) |
| expected_delta | With pipefail, `bash -c 'false \| tail -n 1'` step status 0 → 1; CI's docs step propagates mkdocs's own code. |

### D-L1-02
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | Ruff's S110 (silently-swallowed exception) rule is selected globally but `per-file-ignores` disable it in 12 trees, so the lint gate reports clean while 42 live instances exist. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S1 |
| location | `pyproject.toml:114` (`select` includes `"S"`), `:118-131` (per-file-ignores), `:117` (`ignore = ["S101","E501"]`) |
| mechanism | `select = [... "S" ...]` enables flake8-bandit, so the repository does nominally own a silent-except gate. `S110` is then listed in `per-file-ignores` for `packages/agent`, `plugins`, `datasets`, `evaluation`, `evidence`, `execution`, `llm`, `tools`, `mcp`, `apps/api/routers`, `apps/jupyter` and `tests/**`. The gate is switched off in precisely the modules whose swallowed exceptions §12 treats as correctness-bearing, so "All checks passed!" is produced by configuration, not by absence of defects. This is the config-neutering probe §10 prescribes, and it is the highest-value L1 result because it changes how much of L3's future green is earned. |
| evidence_command | `uv run ruff check packages apps/api tests src apps/jupyter --select S110` vs `uv run ruff check --isolated --select S110 packages apps/api tests src apps/jupyter --output-format=concise` |
| output_excerpt | A (as configured): `All checks passed!` exit 0. B (`--isolated`): `Found 77 errors.` Split by path: `in _vendor (double-counted mirror): 35`, `live (excluding _vendor): 42`. |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Remove `S110` from the per-file-ignores of the shipped trees, then classify each surfaced site per §12 (Hiding / Downgrading / Legitimate) instead of blanket-re-ignoring. Breaks: CI turns red on 35 shipped sites until they are individually dispositioned. Note this **narrows** an exclusion — §R11 and §N6 forbid widening one, not this. |
| blast_radius | `pyproject.toml` lint config + every package listed above; no public contract. 35 shipped-code sites + 7 test sites newly visible. |
| verify_before | `uv run ruff check packages apps/api tests src apps/jupyter --select S110` → `All checks passed!`, exit 0 |
| verify_after | — not applied, pending §18 approval |
| expected_delta | That exact command's output `All checks passed!` → `Found 42 errors` (35 shipped + 7 tests); `_vendor` stays excluded, so 42 not 77. |

### D-L1-03
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `scripts/check_public_claims.py` is inert in four independent ways and cannot detect stale test counts, mypy counts, coverage figures or route counts at all. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S1 |
| location | `scripts/check_public_claims.py:14-35, :222-233, :248-258`; wiring `grep -rn check_public_claims .github/` |
| mechanism | (i) No workflow, hook or schedule invokes it. (ii) Findings are keyed `f"{kind}:{path}"` (`:236`), so only `version_consistency`, `old_package_pip`, `old_repo` reach `return 1` — `stale_version`, `stale_test_counts`, `stale_mypy`, `stale_coverage`, `stale_routes`, `old_package_import` and `maturity` all print and exit 0. (iii) The skip-prefix block discards every match from `docs/`, `plugins/`, `apps/jupyter/`, `src/data_science_agent/`, so four of the twelve `SCAN_GLOBS` entries can never yield a finding — including `docs/**/*.md` and `src/data_science_agent/sdk.py`, which the same file lists as targets. (iv) `EXPECTED` is commented "from pyproject/CITATION live" but is a literal dict in which only `version` is ever read; the other 19 keys (`pytest`, `mypy`, `coverage`, `routes`, `sbom`, …) are unreferenced, and the patterns hard-code three old strings. So a document claiming any wrong number is invisible unless it happens to repeat `155`/`86+`/`86`. Combined with §23's own warning that exit 0 is not a pass, this is why the §0 step-5 result means nothing on its own. |
| evidence_command | scratch copy at `/tmp/claims_probe` (script + minimal `pyproject.toml`/`CITATION.cff`/`sdk.py`/`__init__.py`/`sbom.json`), `GITHUB_REF_NAME=release/v4.4.0-rc`, six injections P0-P5 |
| output_excerpt | P0 clean → `✓ No stale claims detected — 0 issues` exit 0. P1 `4.0.0` in README → `Found 1 potential stale claim(s): [stale_version:README.md] '4.0.0'` / `⚠ Low/medium issues` **exit 0**. P2 `pip install data-science-agent` → **exit 1**. P3 `4.0.0`/`3.0.0`/`2.0.0` in `docs/foo.md` → **0 issues, exit 0**. P4 `999 tests passing, mypy 555 issues, coverage 12%` → **0 issues, exit 0**. P5 `155 tests` → found, **exit 0**. Fail-closed control: scratch `pyproject.toml` version 4.3.9 → `[version_consistency] version mismatch: pyproject=4.3.9 != expected 4.4.0` **exit 1**. |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | (a) wire it into `ci.yml`; (b) delete or honour the dead `EXPECTED` keys; (c) drop `docs/` and `src/data_science_agent/` from the skip list so its stated targets are actually read. Breaks: enabling it will fail CI on whatever `docs/` really contains — unknown, and that unknown is the finding. |
| blast_radius | `scripts/check_public_claims.py` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (approval needed); no runtime code, no public contract. |
| verify_before | P4: a README asserting a wholly wrong test/mypy/coverage triple → `0 issues`, exit 0 |
| verify_after | — not applied, pending §18 approval |
| expected_delta | `grep -rn check_public_claims .github/` hits 0 → ≥1; P4's result `0 issues` → a non-empty finding list. |

### D-L1-04
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `sync_vendor.py --check` cannot detect a vendored copy whose source directory no longer exists, and `--check` is not read-only. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S1 |
| location | `scripts/sync_vendor.py:48-50` (`WARN` + `continue`), `:85` (`changed = sync()` on both paths), `:74-75` (`rmtree`/`copytree`), `:96-104` (`before == after` decides) |
| mechanism | `sync()` skips any source that is not a directory, so the corresponding `_vendor/<name>/` tree is never revisited; `before` and `after` are snapshots of `_vendor` only, so an orphaned copy is byte-identical in both and the drift test passes. Consequence: delete or rename a package (the stub-package question in §13.3, governed by §R10) and the stale duplicate keeps shipping in the wheel while CI prints OK. Second, independent point: `main()` always runs `sync()`, so `--check` mutates the checkout it is auditing and infers drift from whether *its own copy* changed bytes — contradicting §24 R3 and §33's "bare `sync_vendor.py` writes; use `--check`", which presents `--check` as the non-writing form. |
| evidence_command | scratch tree `/tmp/svprobe` with an orphaned `_vendor/dsa_agent/old.py` and no matching source |
| output_excerpt | 15 × `WARN: missing source /private/tmp/svprobe/...` then `OK: vendored dsa_* is in sync` → `check_exit=0`, with the orphaned file present; control run after deleting the orphan: identical output, `control_exit=0`. Real repo: `--check` exit 0 and the `git status --short` that follows it unchanged, so no byte drift existed to rewrite. |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Add orphan detection: any `_vendor/<name>` with no key in `SOURCES`, or any key in `SOURCES` whose dest exists while its src does not, is drift. Separately, make `--check` compare src→dst hashes without copying. Breaks: a clean `--check` may start reporting real orphans. |
| blast_radius | `scripts/sync_vendor.py`; affects trust in `ci.yml:75` and in the published wheel's contents. No public contract change. |
| verify_before | orphaned `_vendor/dsa_agent/old.py` → `OK: vendored dsa_* is in sync`, exit 0 |
| verify_after | — not applied, pending §18 approval |
| expected_delta | Same scratch invocation: exit `0` → `1`, and `OK:` → `DRIFT:`. |
| status | open |
| commit | — |
| protected | no — but see §21.4: §32.3 protects "`--check` passing" as a healthy signal; this finding refines *what it checks* and does not propose replacing the mechanism. |

### D-L1-05
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `mkdocs build --strict` has no link signal, because `mkdocs.yml` downgrades both link validations to `ignore` while `CONTRIBUTING.md:28` mandates the strict check. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S2 |
| location | `mkdocs.yml:43-46` (`validation: links: not_found: ignore / absolute_links: ignore`); mandate at `CONTRIBUTING.md:28`; invocation `ci.yml:163` |
| mechanism | `--strict` promotes warnings to errors; `not_found: ignore` stops mkdocs emitting a warning for a broken link in the first place, so there is nothing for `--strict` to escalate. The mandated check is therefore satisfied by any build that renders, and a contributor following `CONTRIBUTING.md` reasonably believes link integrity is covered. Combined with D-L1-01 the step has two independent failure-suppressions. |
| evidence_command | `/tmp/mkprobe` project using the repo's exact `validation` block plus a broken internal link, built with `--strict` |
| output_excerpt | `[missing page](does-not-exist.md)` → `direct_exit=0`, log shows only `INFO - Building documentation…` / `Documentation built in 0.17 seconds`. Real repo: `mkdocs_strict_direct_exit=0`, `43` log lines, `grep -cE "WARNING|ERROR"` → `0`. |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Set `not_found: warn` (keep `absolute_links: ignore` if absolute links are legitimately external). Breaks: any genuinely broken relative link in `docs/` now fails the strict build — currently unknown, and the real build emitted 0 warnings, so the predicted violation count is low. |
| blast_radius | `mkdocs.yml`; docs build only. No source, no contract. |
| verify_before | broken link + repo's validation block under `--strict` → exit 0 |
| verify_after | — not applied, pending §18 approval |
| expected_delta | Same scratch project: exit `0` → `1` on a broken relative link. |

| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `apps/jupyter` is never type-checked in CI, although its mypy override section exists and mypy itself reports that section as unused. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `ci.yml:86` and `publish.yml:58` (`mypy packages apps/api src`); `pyproject.toml` `[[tool.mypy.overrides]] module = "dsa_jupyter.*"`; `mypy_path` includes `apps/jupyter/src`; `ruff` CI paths *do* include `apps/jupyter` |
| mechanism | Ruff lints `apps/jupyter` but mypy's explicit path list omits it, so one surface of the eight is style-checked and never type-checked. The config file still carries a `dsa_jupyter.*` override, and mypy's `warn_unused_configs` reports it as dead on every CI run — the tool itself is announcing that a configuration section exists for code it never examines. `dsa_jupyter` is also a declared coverage source, so tests touching it register coverage against an untype-checked module. |
| evidence_command | baseline §0 mypy run + `uv run mypy apps/jupyter --ignore-missing-imports` |
| output_excerpt | CI-equivalent run: `pyproject.toml: note: unused section(s): module = ['dsa_jupyter.*']` / `Success: no issues found in 108 source files`. jupyter-only run: `Success: no issues found in 4 source files`. |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Append `apps/jupyter` to the mypy path list in `ci.yml:86` and `publish.yml:58`. Breaks: nothing measured — the module type-checks clean today, so this is a zero-violation gate extension. |
| blast_radius | Two workflow files (approval needed, §R7); 4 files newly type-covered. |
| verify_before | mypy reports `unused section(s): … dsa_jupyter.*` and checks `108 source files` |
| verify_after | — not applied: workflow edit, §R7 / §27 |

|---|---|
| claim | Nothing verifies which copy of a `dsa_*` module the test session imports, so a failure of `conftest.py`'s `_vendor` demotion would be silently absorbed. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 (consequence) / T3 (absence of a guard) |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `conftest.py:26-36` (`try: import data_science_agent … except Exception: pass`), `:4-24` (`if p.exists():` path inserts) |
| mechanism | The shim is load-bearing, not decorative: with it, `dsa_agent` resolves to `packages/agent/src`; without it, `import data_science_agent` puts `_vendor` on `sys.path[0]` and the same import resolves to `src/data_science_agent/_vendor/dsa_agent/__init__.py` — demonstrated below. If the demotion ever no-ops (the `except Exception: pass`, or the `while … in sys.path` string match failing because the two paths are computed independently), the suite would exercise the vendored mirror while coverage — which omits `*/_vendor/*` — attributes nothing, and no assertion would notice. A scoped grep for any test touching import identity (`__file__`, `_vendor`, `sys.path`) returns only unrelated path/`REPO` constants; `tests/test_automation_scripts.py` asserts on pure helpers only. §10 asks this question directly; the answer is "no test would notice". |
| evidence_command | `uv run python -c "import data_science_agent, dsa_agent; print(dsa_agent.__file__)"` and the same with conftest's demotion applied |
| output_excerpt | without demotion → `dsa_agent -> /Users/jackson/Data agent/src/data_science_agent/_vendor/dsa_agent/__init__.py`; with demotion → `…/packages/agent/src/dsa_agent/__init__.py` |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | One guard test asserting `"/_vendor/" not in dsa_agent.__file__` for a representative package. Breaks: nothing today. §N3 caveat recorded honestly: such a test is **green on arrival**, so it cannot be red-then-green in the usual sense — the red must be produced by injecting a broken shim (e.g. monkeypatching the demotion off) and showing the guard fires. |
| blast_radius | `conftest.py` / one new test file. No product code, no contract. |
| verify_before | no test asserts import identity (scoped grep → 0 relevant hits); wrong-shim resolution demonstrably yields `_vendor` |
| verify_after | — not applied, pending §18 approval |
| expected_delta | pytest collected 397 → 398, with the new test green under normal conftest and red under an injected demotion failure. |
| status | open |
| commit | — |
| protected | partial — §32.3 protects the shim's **existence** and `conftest.py`'s demotion as correct-by-design. This finding asks only that it be *observed*, not changed. |

|---|---|
| claim | CI's SBOM step asserts the existence of a file the same step just created, so it can never fail. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T2 (read of the step; not executed — it mutates a tracked file) |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `.github/workflows/ci.yml:88` |
| mechanism | `uv run python scripts/generate_sbom.py && test -f release/sbom.json` — the left operand writes `release/sbom.json`, so `test -f` restates the writer's success rather than checking anything about the SBOM (no version, no package count, no schema). §23 already notes the script "always exits 0"; the assertion added on top is vacuous. §32.3 protects the SBOM artifact itself; this is about the check, not the artifact. |
| evidence_command | `grep -n "generate_sbom" .github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| output_excerpt | `ci.yml:88: - run: uv run python scripts/generate_sbom.py && test -f release/sbom.json  # §47 SBOM` |
| reproducible | not executed (§R8: mutates a tracked file) |
| fix_sketch | Assert content instead: the SBOM's `version` equals `pyproject` version and its package list is non-empty. Breaks: nothing if true; surfaces a real mismatch if false. |

### D-L1-09
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is not a gate: it is absent from CI and both of its hooks rewrite rather than fail. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 (wiring) / T2 (mutating behaviour, not executed) |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `.pre-commit-config.yaml:1-7`; `grep -rn "pre-commit\|pre_commit" .github/` → no hits, exit 1 |
| mechanism | `ruff` runs with `args: [--fix]` and `ruff-format` runs without `--check`, so a violation is silently repaired instead of reported — meaning pre-commit can exit 0 on code that `ci.yml` would reject. Its delta against the §23 table is 2 of ~13 gates (lint + format), and it covers none of mypy, tests, coverage, vendor drift, npm lock, leaderboard, mkdocs or SBOM. §23 already warns "pre-commit success is not equivalent to this table"; the measurement is that it is not even a failing check of that subset. |
| evidence_command | `grep -rn "pre-commit\|pre_commit" .github/ ; echo $?` |
| output_excerpt | `NOT IN CI (exit 1)` |
| reproducible | deterministic |

### D-L1-10
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | The tests+coverage gate prints no test count, so losing tests outright is invisible in the gate's own output. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `pyproject.toml:168` (`addopts = "-q --asyncio-mode=auto"`) combined with §0/§23's `uv run pytest -q …` |
| mechanism | `addopts` already supplies `-q`, and the documented gate command adds another, so pytest runs at `-qq` and omits the `N passed in Ts` line. The §16 baseline field "pytest: <?> passed, <?> failed" cannot be filled from the gate's output; I had to count progress-row characters to derive 397. A deleted, renamed or non-collected test leaves no trace except a small coverage move. |
| evidence_command | `grep -n "passed" /tmp/audit0/02d_pytest.log` on the §0 step-2 capture |
| output_excerpt | zero matches (`grep -c . ` over the file: 146 lines, none containing `passed`); derived count from `head -6 log \| grep -o '^\.\+' \| awk '{s+=length($0)}'` → `dots=397`, and 0 status characters other than `.` |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Use `--tb=short -q` in the documented command, or add `--durations`-free `-ra`, or drop `-q` from `addopts`. Prefer documenting a report flag over editing `addopts`, which would change every developer's local run. |
| blast_radius | documentation of the gate command, or one `pyproject.toml` line. |
| verify_before | gate output contains no `passed` line |

### D-L1-11
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | `tests/unit/test_data_engine.py` guards two **mandatory** dependencies with `pytest.importorskip`, and its stated reason contradicts `pyproject.toml`. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T1 |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `tests/unit/test_data_engine.py:5-6`; `pyproject.toml:31-32` (`"duckdb>=1.0"`, `"polars>=1.0"`) |
| mechanism | The reason strings read "Phase 2: duckdb not yet required", but both are unconditional runtime dependencies of the distribution, so in any real environment the skip branch is unreachable and the assertion is dead weight; in the one environment where it *is* reachable (deps removed), the test skips, the suite stays green, and §16's regression tripwire (`pytest.mark.skip`/`xfail` = 0) does not count `importorskip` at all. The tripwire has a hole in its own definition, which is why the §3.1 "0 skips" claim is simultaneously true and not the whole story. |
| evidence_command | `grep -rnE "pytest\.mark\.(skip|xfail)\|xfail" packages apps/api src tests scripts docs --include='*.py' \| grep -v _vendor \| wc -l` then the same for `importorskip` |
| output_excerpt | marks: `0`. `importorskip`: `2` — `tests/unit/test_data_engine.py:5` and `:6`. |
| reproducible | deterministic for the counts; the skip branch itself not exercised (T1 ceiling) |
| fix_sketch | Drop the two `importorskip` calls and import directly, so a missing hard dependency is an error rather than a silence. Breaks: nothing, since both are required deps. |
| blast_radius | one test file |
| verify_before | 397 collected, all dots, 0 skips — the guard never fires here |
| verify_after | — |
| expected_delta | `importorskip` count in tracked tests 2 → 0; §16 tripwire line gains an `importorskip` term. |

### D-L1-12
| field | value |
|---|---|
| claim | Two of the authorized command surfaces are not runnable as written on this host. |
| lane | L1 |
| evidence_tier | T0 |
| severity | S3 |
| location | `REPO_DIAGNOSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT.md` §0 step 3 and §23/§33 (`python scripts/render_leaderboard.py --check`); §4's expected-untracked-line list |
| mechanism | Bare `python` is absent (`command not found`, exit 127); only `python3` and `uv` resolve, so §0's step-3 gate and §23's leaderboard row cannot be reproduced verbatim. CI is *not* affected — `leaderboard.yml:26-29` uses `setup-python`, which puts `python` on PATH — so this is a local-replication and DX defect, not a product defect, and §33's rule ("record it as a finding and carry on") applies. Separately, §4 predicts "at most two untracked lines" and enumerates `data-science-agent/` + `AUDIT_LEDGER.md`, omitting `REPO_DIAGNOSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT.md` itself, which §24 R1 does acknowledge — the two sections disagree. |
| evidence_command | `(python scripts/render_leaderboard.py --check); echo $?`; `command -v python python3 uv` |
| output_excerpt | `render_leaderboard_check_exit=127` / `(eval):1: command not found: python`; `command -v` → `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, `/Users/jackson/.local/bin/uv`, nothing for `python`. Via wrapper: exit 0, `Leaderboard is valid and synchronized (1 entries).` |
| reproducible | deterministic |
| fix_sketch | Document `uv run python` for these two lines (the prompt document, not the repo) and add a Makefile/justfile so the scoped gate set is discoverable — §20 uplift item 6. |
| blast_radius | instructions surface only |
| verify_before | exit 127 |
| verify_after | exit 0 via `uv run python` |
| expected_delta | §0 step 3 reproduced verbatim: 127 → 0 after documenting the wrapper. |
